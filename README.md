🧠 NeuroVision – AI-Powered Neurological Disorder Detection
📌 Overview

NeuroVision is a deep learning-based system for detecting neurological disorders from medical images.
The project leverages GoogLeNet (Inception v1) with transfer learning to classify disorders with high accuracy.

🚀 Features

Medical Image Classification using GoogLeNet (Inception v1)

Transfer Learning for efficient training on limited datasets

Explainable AI (Grad-CAM) (optional if you used it) for model interpretability

Full pipeline for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation
